      <description><![CDATA[<p>I met a woman today.</p>
<p>Our church helped the local YMCA celebrate Healthy Kids Day, so I was greeting parents and children with some others from my church in the lobby of the local YMCA.  We're 10 minutes from Philadelphia, so it's an extremely diverse group of people we're working with here.  One woman in particular pushed a baby stroller through the door with 3 other children hanging on the side.  We greeted her like the other 300 parents and kids we met, offered her kids some silly kid trinkets and invited them all to our Friday night kid's club at the YMCA.</p>
<p>Her response took me back a bit.  &quot;Ya'll look like you're rich.  You rich?  White people are all rich.  We black people are poor.&quot;  My mind was racing looking for an appropriate yet thoughtful answer, but I was honestly at a loss for words.  I wanted her to know it wasn't at all about money; we're offering this kids club free to anyone, and God's love extends alot further than the checkbook.  But I just sort of stood there, mouth gaping.</p>
<p>She eventually left and I sat and thought about it for a while.  I searched her out and tried to talk to her some more, to let her know that I wasn't just a white guy who didn't want anything to do with her.  But her questions were more of the same.  Did I think black women were pretty?  Would I date a black woman or did I think they were all ugly?  Did I want kids or was I just trying to make money?  I answered the questions carefully and honestly.  Then I invited her to church and told her that I'd come pick her up if she needed a ride.  But my heart was so burdened.</p>
<p>I've never been called a racist before.  In fact, I didn't really know it was much of a problem in America until I went to college down South, where many of my roommates were racist and many of my friends were black.  I didn't like every black person I met, but then, I didn't like every white person I met.  If someone is selfish or immature, it doesn't matter what the color of their skin is, they need work.</p>
<p>I guess what's weighing on my heart right now is the question: how should I have responded in that situation?  I believe we're to love like God loves, and that certainly isn't limited by melanin.  Talking to any other person I would have just spoken the truth in love; talking to this woman I felt like I had to go out of my way to prove that I didn't hate black people.  Which felt so strange, because I don't.</p>
<p>Hopefully she'll call for a ride to church.</p>

      <title>Election Day, 2016</title>
      <link>https://plasticmind.com/journal/election-day-2016/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>If you follow me on Facebook, you know I’ve been thinking (and writing) a lot about this upcoming election. Now that Election Day is here, I thought I’d share a few final thoughts as I head into the voting booth.</p>
<h2>My Faith Informs My Vote</h2>
<p>First, a few thoughts about being a Christian and a citizen.  Some non-Christian friends argue that faith should be kept out of the public sphere, but it’s a key part of who I am, and it informs all areas of my life and actions, so it inevitably affects how I vote. Asking me to set my faith aside when voting is like asking a human being to set their humanity aside when voting.</p>
<p>So when I think about my role as a Christian and as a citizen, I think about what the Bible has to say about those things.  There are a number of verses that address the role of government and our responsibilities.</p>
<p>Romans 13 tells us that God ultimately appoints those who reign and that His intention for rulers is to punish evil and reward good. It mentions with little fanfare that we ought to be subject to them. Jesus made a similar statement, “Render to Caesar that which is Caesar’s.” Of course, that leaves some room for disagreement (e.g. “Caesar doesn’t have the right to estate taxes” or “Caesar shouldn’t be using public funds to pay for abortions.”) When you consider that all of these verses were written to people under an oppressive, dictatorial, and often murderous Roman regime, it’s hard not to get the message: be subject to those in authority over you, even in oppressive situations, as long as you aren’t required to disobey God in the process.</p>
<p>1 Timothy 2 infuses some spiritual responsibility here as well: we are to pray for those in authority. Justyn Martyr once argued that, “no one can feel hatred toward those for whom they pray,” though I’ve spoken with Christians who argued that Timothy passage can also include imprecatory prayers (i.e. asking God to crush a clear enemy).  There are some additional principles we can take away from the old testament, but we have to be careful not to confuse Israel’s theocracy (rule by divine direction) with America’s democratic republic (rule by the people through elected officials).</p>
<p>That’s an important point, and one worth addressing, because I’ve heard a lot of people this election cycle make statements comparing candidates to Israel’s kings or judges, as if our standard for electing American officials to represent us in the 21st century is somehow comparable to prophets anointing people to reign without any democratic input. To put a finer point on this, let me say it this way: if King David were running for office, I probably wouldn’t vote for him. He was a bloody man. He put his troops in harm’s way, even intentionally had one killed just so he could take that soldier’s wife.  But here’s the important point: he wasn’t elected by constituents. God chose him. If you think God should be choosing our candidates today, you’re entitled to that opinion; but that’s not currently how it works. We live in a representative government.  As such, it’s my responsibility to elect people into office who will best represent me, who I trust enough to not only make decisions that reflect my interests but also balance the competing interests of our nation fairly. Unfortunately, the two leading candidates for the office of President don’t represent me—at all.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things that matter to me:</p>
<h2>The Issues</h2>
<h3>Abortion</h3>
<p>This is a big, important issue for me. I am extremely pro-life. The idea of killing a baby in the womb sickens me and gets me so upset that I sometimes can't speak about the topic for fear of losing my temper.</p>
<p>Recently, I've seen a lot of friends I love giving in to the inevitability of Donald Trump. &quot;He's done some pretty terrible things and is largely unfit for office; but he's pro-life and that's all that matters.&quot;</p>
<p>In some ways, I can sympathize. If a Trump presidency means fewer abortions, isn't it worth the downsides of bringing someone like him into office? The trouble with that thinking is that is assumes that a vote for Donald Trump is a vote for fewer abortions, and a vote for Hillary Clinton or a non-vote or a third-party vote is a vote for more abortions. I'm not convinced that's the case.</p>
<p>First, Trump is a recent &quot;convert&quot; to his pro-life position, and even then it took him a few days before being able to articulate just exactly what that position was. It seems naive to think that he will be a champion for the pro-life cause, especially since he will be expending significant political capital for his bigger projects like building a wall and establishing big import tariffs.</p>
<p>Second, I'm not entirely convinced that a President's stance on abortion has a huge impact on the actual abortion rate (which is what matters most to me). Abortions have been on the decline since George H.W. Bush took office, even during Clinton's and Obama's time in office. (See chart below.)</p>
<p>Third, Republican-appointed justices have had the majority in the Supreme Court for almost 40 years and haven't been able to touch Roe v. Wade.</p>
<p>I put together this graph that shows the decline in the overall abortion rate in this country along with the President and the Supreme Court Justices in office since Roe v. Wade.</p>
<img src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/rates.jpg" alt="Abortion Rates in the US" width="638" height="782" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5406" />
<p>I still want to bring that abortion rate WAY down, but I'm not convinced that voting for Trump (or Hillary, for that matter) is the way to do it.</p>
<h3>Immigration</h3>
<p>I love this country, and I’ve been blessed by the freedoms afforded me in this country. I’ve participated in the “American Dream,” and I think it’s a real testament to the power of freedom. It’s important that a legal means of entering this country exist, and that process be followed; but let’s not pretend that there’s an easy solution for a complex human problem. These are real people whose lives matter just as much as yours and mine. The isolationism and the “fear of the other” that some conservatives feed into is incredibly unhealthy. It divides us, makes us suspicious and fearful, prevents us from being empathetic and hospitable.  It pits us against each other, so instead of looking for ways to profit together, we look for ways to “protect what’s ours.” Above all, I think it signals that we think liberty is frail, that the incredible power of freedom can’t drive people to rise above our differences and become better people.</p>
<p>Hillary’s position on this tends to be more in line with my own, though I do think we need to have rigorous checks to ensure that people with clear intents to hurt the country are not allowed in. Trump’s plan to use a religious test to keep people out of this country, though, isn’t just discriminatory, it’s not even in keeping with many of our Founders like Jefferson who welcomed Muslim immigrants. And the wall… it’s just a dumb marketing ploy that even many of his supporters admit is unrealistic.</p>
<h3>National Security</h3>
<p>I believe in a strong military. I’ve got several family members who serve or have served in the military. However, I get concerned about the military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned us about.  I get concerned about a military that needs to prove its worth to stay funded and how that plays out in terms of how we view the world stage. I worry about the ratio of soldiers to civilians, specifically about the large % of contractors acting with little oversight.  More focus needs to be placed on effective use of technology (and cyber defense) instead of just showing force. I’m of the opinion that we should meddle less in foreign affairs, that stuff like training rebels to topple governments usually ends up causing more headache in the long run.</p>
<p>Trump seems to be in favor of a large military since it polls well, though I imagine Clinton’s foreign policy experience and support of the Iraq war would also probably mean a substantial military. McMillan’s experience in the CIA makes me more likely to trust his perspective.</p>
<h3>Trade/Economy</h3>
<p>I’m not an economist, but I tend to favor globalism. I think technology has flattened the world. As much as we want to favor protectionism, even staunch advocates for supporting local businesses still use Amazon.</p>
<p>Trump’s promise that “every product that comes across the border to be sold to the United States… will have a 35% tax on it” is not only unrealistic, I think it would have disastrous consequences for our economy. I think protectionism only helps us in the short term. As much as we want the government to step in and ensure our jobs stay the same they always have, it will ultimately result in stagnation. Technology is forcing business—and the people they employ—to reckon with this change. Putting artificial limits on how industries change is ultimately a disservice to our children. We should instead be recognizing and embracing the new global economy and taking steps to remain competitive in it.</p>
<h3>Gun Rights</h3>
<p>I’m not a huge advocate for gun rights. That’s not to say I don’t believe in the right to bear arms. I absolutely do believe that the 2nd amendment affords us that right, and that the original intention for that amendment wasn’t hunting or sport but to protect citizens from a tyrannical government. I have a gun and know how to use it.  That said, I’m getting very tired of so much gun violence and welcome constructive ideas to address it that may challenge my long-held positions on the topic.</p>
<h2>The Candidates</h2>
<h3>Hillary Clinton</h3>
<p>Hillary Clinton has bungled a lot. She clearly mis-handled Benghazi, and the backflips that she and the Obama administration did in the aftermath to avoid blame were almost worse than the initial attack. It sickens me that earlier this year she dropped “rare” from her “safe, legal, and rare” position on abortion.</p>
<p>The Clinton Foundation stuff is what scares me the most with Hillary. It’s pretty clear that the Clinton's took money in exchange for policy, which doesn’t surprise me, though it does frighten me. The structures she has in place to pull of shady deals like this should give us great pause.</p>
<p>Related, I’m equally concerned how she worked with the DNC to skewer Bernie, who clearly had a huge surge of “outsider” support.  He eventually fell in line behind her because he wanted a seat at the table to represent his values, but the clear “you can’t beat the system” message this sent is troubling, at best.</p>
<p>The email server controversy wasn’t as big an issue for me as it was for some. Sure, she should have gotten in trouble for it (and probably would have if she wasn’t so well connected), but it was more a really decision more than anything. Certainly not as big a deal as Benghazi or the Clinton Foundation pay-to-play stuff, and certainly not as concerning as how easily she lies to cover all of it up.</p>
<p>My biggest concern with Hillary is that she clearly knows how to play politics, and can get pretty much anything she wants because of the massive political infrastructure she's got in place. To vote for someone like that, especially after all of her bad behavior has come to light, sends a message, “We know you lied to us, we know you did things that were illegal, but we’re still handing you the keys to the country.” I can’t bring myself to do that.</p>
<h3>Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Trump is no better, and frankly I think he’s more of a threat to this country than Hillary is.</p>
<p>Some of my friends have accused me of attacking Trump more than Hillary, but I’ve been especially hard on Trump this year primarily because he claims to represent me.  It’s kind of like if you came into my house and one of my family members insulted you: I’d feel way more compelled to step up or distance myself from their remarks because there’s a tacit understanding that, since it happened in my house and by one of my family members, I have some association with it.  So it is with Trump: he’s running in the party that represents me (or used to), he’s claiming to be a conservative champion, he’s got people saying he’s a baby Christian in need of forgiveness. And I’m a Christian who leans politically conservative who has voted Republican in all previous elections. I’ve got more skin in the game here.</p>
<p>Trump opposes free trade and once called for a wealth tax and single-payer health care system. He flip-flopped over abortion, supporting partial-birth abortion and stating he felt like &quot;choice was important&quot;, but later deciding that women who get abortions should be punished. He mocked the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq War, something most Republicans supported at the time (and still do). He publicly called for actions that would violate the Geneva convention. He called for physical violence at his rallies. He's promised to do things that the Constitution doesn't give him the power to do. He said he'd deliver on them anyway, even if they're disruptive or explosive.</p>
<p>How anyhow can consider him a true ambassador of conservative principles is beyond me, let alone someone you trust to run the country. That’s why I’m distancing myself so much from him.</p>
<p>He is the complete embodiment of everything he pretends to hate, yet he's managed to convince many people that he'll fix things. I mean, he even came right out in one of the debates and basically said, &quot;I bought and sold politicians, so I know how it works... which is why I can fix it!&quot; He might as well have said, &quot;I've killed plenty of people and hidden their bodies, so I know all the secrets of a killer... and that's why I'd make the best sheriff!&quot;</p>
<p>I’ve spoken to a lot of Trump supporters who say they just want Trump to “burn it to the ground” and “drain the swamp” and “raze congress,” and while I understand the frustrations, I can’t imagine why anyone would think Trump is the right person to build something greater in its place. His casinos were some of the least profitable, he’s fighting fraud cases against his fake university, he has a hard time articulating much of anything… The unifying message for most Trump supporters has been “Hillary will destroy the country,” which is just the same old message we keep getting fed, “it’s the end of the world as we know it if candidate X gets in office.”  National crisis has almost always been an excuse for poor national choices.</p>
<p>I feel like in this upside-down world, the more level-headed and sensible a candidate is, the less likely you are to appeal to the “fed up with the establishment” crowd because you seem too much like a politician.  Which is strange, because Trump obviously cranked the political gears hard behind closed doors (after, he got a Carson endorsement after comparing him to a child molester), yet he's able to convince his supporters that he's a &quot;man of the people&quot;.</p>
<p>Quite a few Christians I’ve spoken to say, “well, I don’t like Trump, but he’s the lesser of two evils.” That would make some sense if it weren’t for the fact that 73% of Evangelicals voted for Trump in the election. He had clear support from a majority of Christians, even when there were many other options. So the whole “we’re settling for him” argument just doesn’t hold water. He resonated with American evangelicals, and that should tell us something about the state of the church.</p>
<p>Perhaps most concerning to me, though, has been the recent assertion by many Christians—and many so-called Christian leaders—that what a person believes about God, themselves, and their fellow man is of little consequence to how they'd govern. I’m not a perfectionist and I realize that every candidate has flaws; but we’re not just talking cracks in the pavement here, we’re talking about gaping holes down into the bowels of the earth.</p>
<h2>My Choice</h2>
<p>After a lot of thought and consideration, I’ve decided to vote for Evan McMullin. He’s a write-in here in New York State.</p>
<p>He’s a pro-life third-party candidate that much more accurately reflects my values and what I want in leadership. I'm informed enough to know that a third-party win is unlikely, but a vote for Evan means a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the race is close and no one candidate receives the 270 electoral votes required, the choice goes to the House of Representatives, and he would be one of the choices.</li>
<li>It sends a message that neither candidate reflects my values (after all, we live in a representative government, right?), and that I’m sick of having no one in this two-party system that represents me.</li>
<li>It can help eliminate any kind of  “mandate from the people” that either of the favored candidates might bring to office with a blowout win to use for political leverage. *(e.g. I got a huge % of the vote, you’d better work with me to accomplish my agenda.)*</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are my thoughts on today’s vote. I specifically wanted to record them so if this does turn out to be a watershed moment for the country (good? bad?), I could dig them up to show to my children in the hope that they help them through whatever national crisis they’re facing.</p>

<h3>Gun Rights</h3>
<p>I’m not a huge advocate for gun rights. That’s not to say I don’t believe in the right to bear arms. I absolutely do believe that the 2nd amendment affords us that right, and that the original intention for that amendment wasn’t hunting or sport but to protect citizens from a tyrannical government. I have a gun and know how to use it.  That said, I’m getting very tired of so much gun violence and welcome constructive ideas to address it that may challenge my long-held positions on the topic.</p>
<h2>The Candidates</h2>
<h3>Hillary Clinton</h3>
<p>Hillary Clinton has bungled a lot. She clearly mis-handled Benghazi, and the backflips that she and the Obama administration did in the aftermath to avoid blame were almost worse than the initial attack. It sickens me that earlier this year she dropped “rare” from her “safe, legal, and rare” position on abortion.</p>
<p>The Clinton Foundation stuff is what scares me the most with Hillary. It’s pretty clear that the Clinton's took money in exchange for policy, which doesn’t surprise me, though it does frighten me. The structures she has in place to pull of shady deals like this should give us great pause.</p>
<p>Related, I’m equally concerned how she worked with the DNC to skewer Bernie, who clearly had a huge surge of “outsider” support.  He eventually fell in line behind her because he wanted a seat at the table to represent his values, but the clear “you can’t beat the system” message this sent is troubling, at best.</p>
<p>The email server controversy wasn’t as big an issue for me as it was for some. Sure, she should have gotten in trouble for it (and probably would have if she wasn’t so well connected), but it was more a really decision more than anything. Certainly not as big a deal as Benghazi or the Clinton Foundation pay-to-play stuff, and certainly not as concerning as how easily she lies to cover all of it up.</p>
<p>My biggest concern with Hillary is that she clearly knows how to play politics, and can get pretty much anything she wants because of the massive political infrastructure she's got in place. To vote for someone like that, especially after all of her bad behavior has come to light, sends a message, “We know you lied to us, we know you did things that were illegal, but we’re still handing you the keys to the country.” I can’t bring myself to do that.</p>
<h3>Donald Trump</h3>
<p>Trump is no better, and frankly I think he’s more of a threat to this country than Hillary is.</p>
<p>Some of my friends have accused me of attacking Trump more than Hillary, but I’ve been especially hard on Trump this year primarily because he claims to represent me.  It’s kind of like if you came into my house and one of my family members insulted you: I’d feel way more compelled to step up or distance myself from their remarks because there’s a tacit understanding that, since it happened in my house and by one of my family members, I have some association with it.  So it is with Trump: he’s running in the party that represents me (or used to), he’s claiming to be a conservative champion, he’s got people saying he’s a baby Christian in need of forgiveness. And I’m a Christian who leans politically conservative who has voted Republican in all previous elections. I’ve got more skin in the game here.</p>
<p>Trump opposes free trade and once called for a wealth tax and single-payer health care system. He flip-flopped over abortion, supporting partial-birth abortion and stating he felt like &quot;choice was important&quot;, but later deciding that women who get abortions should be punished. He mocked the Bush administration's handling of the Iraq War, something most Republicans supported at the time (and still do). He publicly called for actions that would violate the Geneva convention. He called for physical violence at his rallies. He's promised to do things that the Constitution doesn't give him the power to do. He said he'd deliver on them anyway, even if they're disruptive or explosive.</p>
<p>How anyhow can consider him a true ambassador of conservative principles is beyond me, let alone someone you trust to run the country. That’s why I’m distancing myself so much from him.</p>
<p>He is the complete embodiment of everything he pretends to hate, yet he's managed to convince many people that he'll fix things. I mean, he even came right out in one of the debates and basically said, &quot;I bought and sold politicians, so I know how it works... which is why I can fix it!&quot; He might as well have said, &quot;I've killed plenty of people and hidden their bodies, so I know all the secrets of a killer... and that's why I'd make the best sheriff!&quot;</p>
<p>I’ve spoken to a lot of Trump supporters who say they just want Trump to “burn it to the ground” and “drain the swamp” and “raze congress,” and while I understand the frustrations, I can’t imagine why anyone would think Trump is the right person to build something greater in its place. His casinos were some of the least profitable, he’s fighting fraud cases against his fake university, he has a hard time articulating much of anything… The unifying message for most Trump supporters has been “Hillary will destroy the country,” which is just the same old message we keep getting fed, “it’s the end of the world as we know it if candidate X gets in office.”  National crisis has almost always been an excuse for poor national choices.</p>
<p>I feel like in this upside-down world, the more level-headed and sensible a candidate is, the less likely you are to appeal to the “fed up with the establishment” crowd because you seem too much like a politician.  Which is strange, because Trump obviously cranked the political gears hard behind closed doors (after, he got a Carson endorsement after comparing him to a child molester), yet he's able to convince his supporters that he's a &quot;man of the people&quot;.</p>
<p>Quite a few Christians I’ve spoken to say, “well, I don’t like Trump, but he’s the lesser of two evils.” That would make some sense if it weren’t for the fact that 73% of Evangelicals voted for Trump in the election. He had clear support from a majority of Christians, even when there were many other options. So the whole “we’re settling for him” argument just doesn’t hold water. He resonated with American evangelicals, and that should tell us something about the state of the church.</p>
<p>Perhaps most concerning to me, though, has been the recent assertion by many Christians—and many so-called Christian leaders—that what a person believes about God, themselves, and their fellow man is of little consequence to how they'd govern. I’m not a perfectionist and I realize that every candidate has flaws; but we’re not just talking cracks in the pavement here, we’re talking about gaping holes down into the bowels of the earth.</p>
<h2>My Choice</h2>
<p>After a lot of thought and consideration, I’ve decided to vote for Evan McMullin. He’s a write-in here in New York State.</p>
<p>He’s a pro-life third-party candidate that much more accurately reflects my values and what I want in leadership. I'm informed enough to know that a third-party win is unlikely, but a vote for Evan means a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the race is close and no one candidate receives the 270 electoral votes required, the choice goes to the House of Representatives, and he would be one of the choices.</li>
<li>It sends a message that neither candidate reflects my values (after all, we live in a representative government, right?), and that I’m sick of having no one in this two-party system that represents me.</li>
<li>It can help eliminate any kind of  “mandate from the people” that either of the favored candidates might bring to office with a blowout win to use for political leverage. *(e.g. I got a huge % of the vote, you’d better work with me to accomplish my agenda.)*</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are my thoughts on today’s vote. I specifically wanted to record them so if this does turn out to be a watershed moment for the country (good? bad?), I could dig them up to show to my children in the hope that they help them through whatever national crisis they’re facing.</p>

      <title>The Airbag Has Landed</title>
      <link>https://plasticmind.com/journal/the-airbag-has-landed/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>When <a href="https://twitter.com/Brilliantcrank">Greg Storey</a> asked me to help migrate <a href="https://airbagindustries.com/">Airbag Industries</a> off Movable Type to a modern publishing setup, I was over the moon — for a few reasons.</p>
<p>For starters, I’ve been an Airbag fan for a long time. I met Greg almost ten years ago while hanging with Dave Shea in Austin for a SXSW, and I’ve enjoyed his wit and insight over the years.</p>
<p>Secondly, Greg told me up front that he wanted to go the static publishing/flat-file route. My only exposure to that kind of setup had been some brief dabbling with <a href="https://getgrav.org/">Grav</a> a few years back. Since I tend to do a lot of WordPress development for clients, I was excited for a change of pace.</p>
<h2>The Platform Selection</h2>
<p>Selecting the right platform was our first priority. Greg wanted a flat-file system that got the job done but was only as complex as it needed to be.</p>
<p>I tried out several different platforms and sent Greg my thoughts:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">GatsbyJS</a>: Very heavily focused on React. Introduced a lot of dependencies and felt a bit heavy-handed for a simple publishing site.</li>
    <li><a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>: I was hopeful for Ghost — I actually funded it in its infancy on Kickstarter. But it’s not a true flat file system. It works similarly to WordPress, with articles living in a database (SQL Lite instead of MySQL) and similar templating and URL routing. The server requirements were also a bit more complex (Node and nginx), so we decided to pass.</li>
    <li><a href="https://statamic.com/">Statamic</a>: Seemed like a decent tool, but my initial impression was that it lacked a bit in polish. The asset management workflow seemed complicated (lots of jumping around to insert assets into a post), and the image manipulation library included (Glide) was a bit complex. We decided that a combination of a solid back-end system like Jekyll/Hugo and a front-end tool like Forestry would simplify a lot of that editorial process.</li>
    <li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>: I had some experience with Jekyll on a prior project that was using Jekyll for a style guide, so I was leaning toward Jekyll. We actually decided on Jekyll initially, but even with a few hundred posts in our MVP, the build process was slow (~8 seconds). This “lag” was especially noticeable during the template development process when you’d want to test changes to your code.</li>
    <li><a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>: After our experience with Jekyll and some research about the <a href="https://forestry.io/blog/hugo-vs-jekyll-benchmark/">performance differences between Hugo and Jekyll</a>, we decided to pivot and build the site in Hugo with Forestry at the front end. (Note: Even though we’ve been relatively happy with Forestry, if I had it to do over again, I probably would have gone with Netlify CMS to reduce the complexity of our setup.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Hosting Setup</h2>
<p>Greg had initially wanted to use a traditional hosting setup where the CMS lives on the server and all the content is stored and edited there. However, that had some limitations, so we considered the pros and cons of two different approaches:</p>
<h3>Approach 1: CMS lives on the server, content is stored and edited there</h3>
<p>This approach would have simplified the overall infrastructure and could have been powered using something like Statamic or Jekyll’s Admin GUI. Once set up, any changes made to the content would update the flat-files on the server. No deployment needed.</p>
<p>The challenge is that if we wanted to track updates to the site, we’d need to figure out a way to get changes on the server to get committed automatically to Git. Statamic has some custom tools that allow you to set this up to happen automatically, but setting them up seemed a bit complex.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pros: Works like Movable Type, publishing happens on the server, no deployment needed</li>
    <li>Cons: Local development is difficult as most development has to happen on the server, extra work to get the content to sync with Git (if versioning is desired).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Approach 2: Site content and code is stored in Git, edited there (or using a service like Forestry or Siteleaf), and pushed to your server changes are made.</h3>
<p>We eventually decided a setup like this was most flexible: <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> (installed a local machine) for rapid site design and development, <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry</a> (a hosted service) for day-to-day content creation/editing, <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> to store it all (endless backups, basically), and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to watch Github for any changes and build/deploy as needed.</p>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5967" src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/hugo-setup-1024x538.png" alt="" width="1024" height="538" />
<p>Though it was a little harder to set up and a bit more complicated than the old Movable Type setup, this approach was flexible (you could blog from Github if you wanted to), portable (the site can be quickly checked out on any computer or server), and pretty darn reliable (full site backups on Github and redundancy on every machine where it’s checked out.)</p>
<h2>The Project Plan</h2>
<p>After we settled on a platform and a host, I sent Greg a high level project plan that looked a little something like this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initial Setup: Set up accounts (Forestry, Netlify, Github) and connect all the things.</li>
    <li>Design / Architecture: Review current design/templates together and discuss what should stay vs. what should change. Talk through the overall IA / UX of the site and create architecture plan for new site (url scheme, nav menu, post types, categories, etc.)</li>
    <li>Migration: Move all assets to the new server, create an export template in Movable Type, and export all the posts to the Jekyll/Hugo flat file format.</li>
    <li>QA/Launch: Set up rewrite rules to make sure people can find old articles, spot check the top articles, switch the DNS, and walk Greg through the new site management process</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Dead Mac &#x2620;&#xfe0f;</h2>
<p>A few days after I sent Greg a project plan for the migration, I received this email:</p>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5968" src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-04-at-6.54-AM-1024x399.png" alt="" width="1024" height="399" />
<p>For years, Greg had been running his site with Movable Type on a Mac Mini in his living room, and — just our luck — right as we were ready to begin, the Mac died.</p>
<p>Migrations are almost always messy, a process of connecting two platforms and dealing with incomplete or missing data... so I shouldn’t have been surprised at a bump in the road.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Greg had a JSON export of his content and a zipped backup of the docroot from the year previous, so we weren’t at a complete loss, but my idea of simply exporting the content from MT with a custom template was out the window. I needed to come up with a different approach.</p>
<h2>The Migration</h2>
<p>I initially toyed with the idea of writing a migration script that would parse the JSON, pull out the relevant data, and write it to a format I needed. But as I begin to look over the JSON, I realized that everything was in there: comments, media, site options. Whatever process had exported this content tried to turn a multi-dimensional database into a flat JSON file, and the results weren’t pretty.</p>
<h3>Pivot: OpenRefine</h3>
<p>I’m highly pragmatic (read: lazy) when it comes to migrations, so I decided to look for an existing tool to help me deal with this file.</p>
<p>I can’t remember how I found it, but I stumbled upon <a href="https://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a> which declares itself a “free, open source, powerful tool for working with messy data.” That sounded promising.</p>
<p>I installed it and imported the JSON. It’s such an interesting and helpful tool. I read that a lot of libraries use this to clean up large, messy data sets, and I can understand why. It isn’t pretty, and it takes a while to figure out how to use it, but it’s really good for exploring, cleaning, and transforming data however you need.</p>
<p>What I needed was the page title, the slug, the date, and the post content. I was able to pretty quickly drill into the data I needed and export it to a spreadsheet.</p>
<h3>Culling Content</h3>
<p>Why export the content into a spreadsheet?</p>
<p>Greg had 6000 entries, but a lot of them were links to external sites, many of which were long dead. He wanted to review his content and keep only a fraction of the posts.</p>
<p>To make this easier, I imported the spreadsheet from OpenRefine into Google Sheets and created an extra “keep” column so that Greg could quickly review the list of articles and flag the ones he wanted to keep. We went from 6000 entries to about 600.</p>
<h3>Exporting Content</h3>
<p>Once Greg had selected the posts he wanted to keep, I put together a script that would export the Google Sheets as individual Markdown files in my Google Drive:</p>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5969" src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-1024x690.png" alt="" width="1024" height="690" />
<p>In short, it loops through all the rows in the spreadsheet and creates a file for each in my Google drive with a filename based on the date and slug and the file contents based on the spreadsheet contents.</p>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5970" src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-2-1024x741.png" alt="" width="1024" height="741" />
<p>Basically, this script outputs the flat Markdown files our static site generator needs. I was able to drop these files into the <code>content/posts</code> folder and Hugo processed them with no trouble.</p>
<h3>Cleaning Up Content</h3>
<p>We weren’t done, though. Even though the content had been exported, there were significant character encoding issues.</p>
<h4>Line Breaks</h4>
<p>At first, I thought I had botched the export of content from the JSON file, collapsing the extra line breaks that tell Markdown to render <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> but after reviewing the JSON files, I realized that both the markup and HTML output in the JSON file didn’t have these breaks. The HTML included only <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags and the Markdown only had a single newline.</p>
<p>The good news is that thanks to a good old fashioned Linux one-liner (<code>sed  -i.bak G *</code>), I was able to add a new line to every line break for every post, which resolved the issue. This posed a problem for lists, which require hyphens at the beginning of the line and <em>no</em> break between, but I was able to clean that up. I know that’s probably TMI… but the end result was that posts correctly rendered paragraph blocks instead of just line breaks.</p>
<h4>Character encoding</h4>
<p>The source content contained a lot character encoding issues, specifically mixed encoding issues (e.g. a character has been encoded twice), even in the source file. This was especially annoying, and I thought I was going to have to use something industrial strength like this killer Python library called FTFY that seems to <a href="https://ftfy.now.sh/">handle this botched encoding pretty well</a> .</p>
<p>However, since we had moved everything into flat files, I found that it was much faster to do some smart search/replace magic to address character encoding issues with em dash, en dash, ellipses, and curly single and double quotes. All in all, about 160 articles were updated.</p>
<h4>Block quotes</h4>
<p>Because Greg tends to quote external articles, I also ran a few regular expressions to transform a quote class for block quotes into Markdown’s block quote syntax.</p>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5971" src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-04-at-9.49-AM-1024x615.png" alt="" width="1024" height="615" />
<h4>Asset references</h4>
<p>Thankfully, we didn’t have too many asset references in the content that we had to deal with. I copied whatever assets were included in the posts (generally referenced in <code>bucket</code> and <code>images</code> folders) to a new uploads folder. That way, I could set up a redirect so any requests for <code>/bucket/</code> or <code>/images/</code> get passed to <code>/uploads/</code>. Incidentally, Forestry uploads media assets to the <code>/uploads/</code> folder, so this strategy worked out well.</p>
<h3>Templating</h3>
<p>It was a bit of a learning curve for me to figure out Hugo. The directory structure, content organization, and templating (Hugo uses the “Go” templating language) were all foreign to me, but the <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">Hugo documentation</a> is solid. Also, The Airbag Industries site has a relatively straightforward content model — posts, pages, a menu, an archive page, and a site feed — so building out the site was relatively simple.</p>
<p>One other note about building with Hugo: I love how simple the setup was. I avoided the boilerplates because I didn’t want the additional complexity of including Gulp or any kind of Node modules. We weren’t compiling JS, and <a href="https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/scss-sass/">Hugo Pipes</a> lets you process SASS files without a complex dependency chain. I can’t tell you how excited I am that I only need to check out a repo, install Hugo and run <code>hugo serve</code> when developing for the site.</p>
<p>I also can’t say enough how helpful <a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/jekyll-ghpages-to-hugo-netlify/">Sara Soueidan’s article on moving from Jekyll to Hugo</a> was throughout this process. It helped me tremendously. If you’re building a site on Hugo, do yourself a favor and read the whole thing. Lots of practical information in there.</p>
<h3>Rewrite Rules</h3>
<p>The last key step for the project was setting up URL rewrite rules so that old links still worked.</p>
<p>I thought I’d be able to grab the slug from the JSON export and use it to handle the redirects, e.g. <code>/archives/airbag/{SLUG}.php</code> → <code>/{SLUG}/</code>. However, I discovered late in the process that the slug in the JSON export and the actual page locations on site didn’t match. Darn. (See earlier point about migrations being messy.)</p>
<p>It turns out that his Movable Type setup had some custom rules for slugs: capped at 15 characters, using _ instead of - for spaces, and eliminating hyphens. It also seems like some slugs have been automatically truncated (e.g. Latte Induced Thinking →<code>latte_induced_t.php</code>) while others have been manually truncated (e.g. Attack Pattern Delta → <code>attack_pattern.php</code>).</p>
<p>We decide to put the aforementioned redirect in place (Netlify lets you define redirects in a <code>netlify.toml</code> file at the root of your site):</p>
<pre><code># Redirect for legacy permalinks
[[redirects]]
  from = “/archives/airbag/*.php”
  to = “/:splat”
</code></pre>
<p>This handled a good percentage of the articles and most titles were under 15 characters. For articles that didn’t match the pattern, we just put in manual redirects.</p>

<h2>Post-mortem</h2>
<p>This project took a bit longer than expected, and it wasn’t just because of the unexpected dead Mac. Some of the things that made this take a bit longer:</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>**My general unfamiliarity with flat-file systems.** This unfamiliarity meant a fair bit of learning up front. The biggest challenge was trying to figure out the nuances around template inheritance and content loops (both are common concepts in WordPress, but they were different enough to hang me up a bit.)</li>
    <li>**Switching platforms mid-build.** Only once I got the bulk of the articles pulled into Jekyll did the slow build time really become a problem. Thankfully, Hugo’s setup and templating aren’t too dissimilar from Jekyll, and nearly all of the content’s formatting stayed the same, so the switch wasn’t as painful as it could have been.</li>
    <li>**Switching hosts mid-build.** I tried for a while to get Hugo publishing to a more traditional host, but it required *one more tool* to manage deployments (<a href="https://deploybot.com/">Deploybot</a>) and because deployment and hosting weren’t integrated, every deployment took a while, making the entire setup feel especially slow. Switching to Netlify for integrated hosting and deployment sped this whole process up.</li>
    <li>**No database.** While I knew this was a problem early on, it did add 30-40% more effort to the project overall. Even though we had a JSON dump of the content, it was filled with lots of malformed or double-encoded characters which required significant amounts of TLC.</li>

    <li>Cons: Local development is difficult as most development has to happen on the server, extra work to get the content to sync with Git (if versioning is desired).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Approach 2: Site content and code is stored in Git, edited there (or using a service like Forestry or Siteleaf), and pushed to your server changes are made.</h3>
<p>We eventually decided a setup like this was most flexible: <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> (installed a local machine) for rapid site design and development, <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry</a> (a hosted service) for day-to-day content creation/editing, <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> to store it all (endless backups, basically), and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to watch Github for any changes and build/deploy as needed.</p>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5967" src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/hugo-setup-1024x538.png" alt="" width="1024" height="538" />
<p>Though it was a little harder to set up and a bit more complicated than the old Movable Type setup, this approach was flexible (you could blog from Github if you wanted to), portable (the site can be quickly checked out on any computer or server), and pretty darn reliable (full site backups on Github and redundancy on every machine where it’s checked out.)</p>
<h2>The Project Plan</h2>
<p>After we settled on a platform and a host, I sent Greg a high level project plan that looked a little something like this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initial Setup: Set up accounts (Forestry, Netlify, Github) and connect all the things.</li>
    <li>Design / Architecture: Review current design/templates together and discuss what should stay vs. what should change. Talk through the overall IA / UX of the site and create architecture plan for new site (url scheme, nav menu, post types, categories, etc.)</li>
    <li>Migration: Move all assets to the new server, create an export template in Movable Type, and export all the posts to the Jekyll/Hugo flat file format.</li>
    <li>QA/Launch: Set up rewrite rules to make sure people can find old articles, spot check the top articles, switch the DNS, and walk Greg through the new site management process</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Dead Mac &#x2620;&#xfe0f;</h2>
<p>A few days after I sent Greg a project plan for the migration, I received this email:</p>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5968" src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-04-at-6.54-AM-1024x399.png" alt="" width="1024" height="399" />
<p>For years, Greg had been running his site with Movable Type on a Mac Mini in his living room, and — just our luck — right as we were ready to begin, the Mac died.</p>
<p>Migrations are almost always messy, a process of connecting two platforms and dealing with incomplete or missing data... so I shouldn’t have been surprised at a bump in the road.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Greg had a JSON export of his content and a zipped backup of the docroot from the year previous, so we weren’t at a complete loss, but my idea of simply exporting the content from MT with a custom template was out the window. I needed to come up with a different approach.</p>
<h2>The Migration</h2>
<p>I initially toyed with the idea of writing a migration script that would parse the JSON, pull out the relevant data, and write it to a format I needed. But as I begin to look over the JSON, I realized that everything was in there: comments, media, site options. Whatever process had exported this content tried to turn a multi-dimensional database into a flat JSON file, and the results weren’t pretty.</p>
<h3>Pivot: OpenRefine</h3>
<p>I’m highly pragmatic (read: lazy) when it comes to migrations, so I decided to look for an existing tool to help me deal with this file.</p>
<p>I can’t remember how I found it, but I stumbled upon <a href="https://openrefine.org/">OpenRefine</a> which declares itself a “free, open source, powerful tool for working with messy data.” That sounded promising.</p>
<p>I installed it and imported the JSON. It’s such an interesting and helpful tool. I read that a lot of libraries use this to clean up large, messy data sets, and I can understand why. It isn’t pretty, and it takes a while to figure out how to use it, but it’s really good for exploring, cleaning, and transforming data however you need.</p>
<p>What I needed was the page title, the slug, the date, and the post content. I was able to pretty quickly drill into the data I needed and export it to a spreadsheet.</p>
<h3>Culling Content</h3>
<p>Why export the content into a spreadsheet?</p>
<p>Greg had 6000 entries, but a lot of them were links to external sites, many of which were long dead. He wanted to review his content and keep only a fraction of the posts.</p>
<p>To make this easier, I imported the spreadsheet from OpenRefine into Google Sheets and created an extra “keep” column so that Greg could quickly review the list of articles and flag the ones he wanted to keep. We went from 6000 entries to about 600.</p>
<h3>Exporting Content</h3>
<p>Once Greg had selected the posts he wanted to keep, I put together a script that would export the Google Sheets as individual Markdown files in my Google Drive:</p>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5969" src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-1024x690.png" alt="" width="1024" height="690" />
<p>In short, it loops through all the rows in the spreadsheet and creates a file for each in my Google drive with a filename based on the date and slug and the file contents based on the spreadsheet contents.</p>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5970" src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/unnamed-2-1024x741.png" alt="" width="1024" height="741" />
<p>Basically, this script outputs the flat Markdown files our static site generator needs. I was able to drop these files into the <code>content/posts</code> folder and Hugo processed them with no trouble.</p>
<h3>Cleaning Up Content</h3>
<p>We weren’t done, though. Even though the content had been exported, there were significant character encoding issues.</p>
<h4>Line Breaks</h4>
<p>At first, I thought I had botched the export of content from the JSON file, collapsing the extra line breaks that tell Markdown to render <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> but after reviewing the JSON files, I realized that both the markup and HTML output in the JSON file didn’t have these breaks. The HTML included only <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags and the Markdown only had a single newline.</p>
<p>The good news is that thanks to a good old fashioned Linux one-liner (<code>sed  -i.bak G *</code>), I was able to add a new line to every line break for every post, which resolved the issue. This posed a problem for lists, which require hyphens at the beginning of the line and <em>no</em> break between, but I was able to clean that up. I know that’s probably TMI… but the end result was that posts correctly rendered paragraph blocks instead of just line breaks.</p>
<h4>Character encoding</h4>
<p>The source content contained a lot character encoding issues, specifically mixed encoding issues (e.g. a character has been encoded twice), even in the source file. This was especially annoying, and I thought I was going to have to use something industrial strength like this killer Python library called FTFY that seems to <a href="https://ftfy.now.sh/">handle this botched encoding pretty well</a> .</p>
<p>However, since we had moved everything into flat files, I found that it was much faster to do some smart search/replace magic to address character encoding issues with em dash, en dash, ellipses, and curly single and double quotes. All in all, about 160 articles were updated.</p>
<h4>Block quotes</h4>
<p>Because Greg tends to quote external articles, I also ran a few regular expressions to transform a quote class for block quotes into Markdown’s block quote syntax.</p>
<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-5971" src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2020-03-04-at-9.49-AM-1024x615.png" alt="" width="1024" height="615" />
<h4>Asset references</h4>
<p>Thankfully, we didn’t have too many asset references in the content that we had to deal with. I copied whatever assets were included in the posts (generally referenced in <code>bucket</code> and <code>images</code> folders) to a new uploads folder. That way, I could set up a redirect so any requests for <code>/bucket/</code> or <code>/images/</code> get passed to <code>/uploads/</code>. Incidentally, Forestry uploads media assets to the <code>/uploads/</code> folder, so this strategy worked out well.</p>
<h3>Templating</h3>
<p>It was a bit of a learning curve for me to figure out Hugo. The directory structure, content organization, and templating (Hugo uses the “Go” templating language) were all foreign to me, but the <a href="https://gohugo.io/documentation/">Hugo documentation</a> is solid. Also, The Airbag Industries site has a relatively straightforward content model — posts, pages, a menu, an archive page, and a site feed — so building out the site was relatively simple.</p>
<p>One other note about building with Hugo: I love how simple the setup was. I avoided the boilerplates because I didn’t want the additional complexity of including Gulp or any kind of Node modules. We weren’t compiling JS, and <a href="https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/scss-sass/">Hugo Pipes</a> lets you process SASS files without a complex dependency chain. I can’t tell you how excited I am that I only need to check out a repo, install Hugo and run <code>hugo serve</code> when developing for the site.</p>
<p>I also can’t say enough how helpful <a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/jekyll-ghpages-to-hugo-netlify/">Sara Soueidan’s article on moving from Jekyll to Hugo</a> was throughout this process. It helped me tremendously. If you’re building a site on Hugo, do yourself a favor and read the whole thing. Lots of practical information in there.</p>
<h3>Rewrite Rules</h3>
<p>The last key step for the project was setting up URL rewrite rules so that old links still worked.</p>
<p>I thought I’d be able to grab the slug from the JSON export and use it to handle the redirects, e.g. <code>/archives/airbag/{SLUG}.php</code> → <code>/{SLUG}/</code>. However, I discovered late in the process that the slug in the JSON export and the actual page locations on site didn’t match. Darn. (See earlier point about migrations being messy.)</p>
<p>It turns out that his Movable Type setup had some custom rules for slugs: capped at 15 characters, using _ instead of - for spaces, and eliminating hyphens. It also seems like some slugs have been automatically truncated (e.g. Latte Induced Thinking →<code>latte_induced_t.php</code>) while others have been manually truncated (e.g. Attack Pattern Delta → <code>attack_pattern.php</code>).</p>
<p>We decide to put the aforementioned redirect in place (Netlify lets you define redirects in a <code>netlify.toml</code> file at the root of your site):</p>
<pre><code># Redirect for legacy permalinks
[[redirects]]
  from = “/archives/airbag/*.php”
  to = “/:splat”
</code></pre>
<p>This handled a good percentage of the articles and most titles were under 15 characters. For articles that didn’t match the pattern, we just put in manual redirects.</p>

<h2>Post-mortem</h2>
<p>This project took a bit longer than expected, and it wasn’t just because of the unexpected dead Mac. Some of the things that made this take a bit longer:</p>
<ol start="1">
    <li>**My general unfamiliarity with flat-file systems.** This unfamiliarity meant a fair bit of learning up front. The biggest challenge was trying to figure out the nuances around template inheritance and content loops (both are common concepts in WordPress, but they were different enough to hang me up a bit.)</li>
    <li>**Switching platforms mid-build.** Only once I got the bulk of the articles pulled into Jekyll did the slow build time really become a problem. Thankfully, Hugo’s setup and templating aren’t too dissimilar from Jekyll, and nearly all of the content’s formatting stayed the same, so the switch wasn’t as painful as it could have been.</li>
    <li>**Switching hosts mid-build.** I tried for a while to get Hugo publishing to a more traditional host, but it required *one more tool* to manage deployments (<a href="https://deploybot.com/">Deploybot</a>) and because deployment and hosting weren’t integrated, every deployment took a while, making the entire setup feel especially slow. Switching to Netlify for integrated hosting and deployment sped this whole process up.</li>
    <li>**No database.** While I knew this was a problem early on, it did add 30-40% more effort to the project overall. Even though we had a JSON dump of the content, it was filled with lots of malformed or double-encoded characters which required significant amounts of TLC.</li>

<h3>Setting It Up</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After <a href="https://danmall.me/articles/better-webcam-video/">Dan Mall turned me on to the Elgato Cam Link</a>, I got excited about the possibility of using my own DSLR as a webcam for my computer. In a nutshell, the Cam Link plugs into a USB port and lets you pull in any HDMI input as a video source on your computer. I own a Canon 5D Mark II with several really nice lenses, so I got excited about the possibility of a setup where I could leverage those lenses for any kind of online video work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I purchased the Cam Link and a Micro-HDMI to HDMI, but I quickly discovered a problem: the Canon 5D Mark II doesn't have clean HDMI output. In other words, when I plugged it in, I got what you'd see on the viewfinder:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:image {"id":5988} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TS560x560.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5988" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can check if your camera outputs clean HDMI with <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/cam-link/camera-check">Elgato's compatibility checking tool</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wish I'd have checked that tool first: the 5D Mark II doesn't have clean HDMI out — but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DQBFB3J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Canon M50</a>, Canon's entry-level mirrorless DSLR does, so I decided to purchase one with the hopes that I could stay in the Canon family and use all my lenses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I had a lot of problems with the M50.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5989} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/download.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5989" /></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a decent standalone camera, but the output wasn't <em>exactly</em> clean. Even with all the viewfinder displays turned off, if you left the autofocus on, a box would appear over your face every time AF kicked in.  There was no way to disable it, so I had to use it in Manual Focus mode — which is a pain if you move around. Also, the M50 has a 3/4 sensor, so I had to purchase a lens conversion kit in order to use my EF lenses, which caused some unwanted cropping and made it so I couldn't really use my good lenses as a webcam anyway. I even tried the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K7CQCCN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Viltrox speed booster</a> to offset the cropping, but that caused all sort of lens distortion and messed with the autofocus. There's even more complication here I'm leaving out: possibly using USB to grab video but needing a paid subscription to Ecamm. Long story short: I was almost $1000 into this and had no satisfying solution.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>About the same time as I was having all these issues, a friend posted a used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Mirrorless-Digitial-3-0-Inch-16-50mm/dp/B00I8BICB2/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=sony+a6000&amp;qid=1584117604&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-3">Sony A6000</a> for sale at a really reasonable price. I had read lots of good things about the A6000 for vlogging, and I knew it supported clean HDMI out, so I decided to return all the Canon items I had purchased back and go the much less expensive used-Sony route.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm glad I did. As soon as I got it home and plugged it in, everything worked as expected, with no headaches. Clean HDMI output. Decent depth of field. No complaints. I mounted it on a cheap but reliable Amazon Basics tripod, and I set the camera to &quot;movie mode&quot; to ensure the highest quality HDMI out (using any other mode sends a much lower resolution output).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only thing worth mentioning with the Sony A6000 is that while you <em>can</em> run it on batteries, you'll only get an hour or so. I decided to purchase a relatively inexpensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075Z4GXKG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">dummy battery</a> that lets me keep the camera on all day without needing to fuss with batteries.</p>

<h2>Lighting</h2>

<p>Here's the bullet list for my audio setup:</p>

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00APAQT4Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">2 x TaoTronics LED Desk Lamp</a></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you buy two of these like I did, it will cost you $60 ($30/each).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Setting It Up</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My lighting setup is simple.  I actually tried several different lighting options like LED panels, but these two LED desk lamps work out really well for me. I keep them aimed down when I'm working, then flip them up when I'm on a call. You can adjust the brightness and color temperature, and they've got USB ports on the side, handy for charging devices.</p>

<p>Here's the bullet list for my audio setup:</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JM46FY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Rode Podcaster</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D7UYBO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Rode PSA1 boom arm</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DE1K5S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Rode SM6 shock mount</a></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This setup is about $400 if you buy everything new.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Setting It Up</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For years, I've used a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2">Blue Yeti Blackout USB microphone</a>. It's a great microphone at a really good price and does a great job. However, my office acoustics are terrible, and after a bit of research, I read that a dynamic mic might help eliminate the background noise and clean up my signal, so I picked up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JM46FY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Rode Podcaster</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So far, I've been happy with the quality. It doesn't pick up nearly as much of the echoes the Yeti did.  My only complaint is that the signal is <em>very</em> weak.  It has no built-in gain control, so the input gain on the computer needs to be set to 100% and the mic really needs to be close to the mouth in order to get a decent signal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also — if you're thinking about any boom arm, save yourself the headache and get the Rode PSA1. I've gone through many mic stands, and this one really is worth the money.</p>

<h3>Setting It Up</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After <a href="https://danmall.me/articles/better-webcam-video/">Dan Mall turned me on to the Elgato Cam Link</a>, I got excited about the possibility of using my own DSLR as a webcam for my computer. In a nutshell, the Cam Link plugs into a USB port and lets you pull in any HDMI input as a video source on your computer. I own a Canon 5D Mark II with several really nice lenses, so I got excited about the possibility of a setup where I could leverage those lenses for any kind of online video work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I purchased the Cam Link and a Micro-HDMI to HDMI, but I quickly discovered a problem: the Canon 5D Mark II doesn't have clean HDMI output. In other words, when I plugged it in, I got what you'd see on the viewfinder:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:image {"id":5988} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/TS560x560.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5988" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can check if your camera outputs clean HDMI with <a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/cam-link/camera-check">Elgato's compatibility checking tool</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wish I'd have checked that tool first: the 5D Mark II doesn't have clean HDMI out — but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DQBFB3J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Canon M50</a>, Canon's entry-level mirrorless DSLR does, so I decided to purchase one with the hopes that I could stay in the Canon family and use all my lenses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I had a lot of problems with the M50.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":5989} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright"><img src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/download.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5989" /></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a decent standalone camera, but the output wasn't <em>exactly</em> clean. Even with all the viewfinder displays turned off, if you left the autofocus on, a box would appear over your face every time AF kicked in.  There was no way to disable it, so I had to use it in Manual Focus mode — which is a pain if you move around. Also, the M50 has a 3/4 sensor, so I had to purchase a lens conversion kit in order to use my EF lenses, which caused some unwanted cropping and made it so I couldn't really use my good lenses as a webcam anyway. I even tried the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K7CQCCN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Viltrox speed booster</a> to offset the cropping, but that caused all sort of lens distortion and messed with the autofocus. There's even more complication here I'm leaving out: possibly using USB to grab video but needing a paid subscription to Ecamm. Long story short: I was almost $1000 into this and had no satisfying solution.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>About the same time as I was having all these issues, a friend posted a used <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Mirrorless-Digitial-3-0-Inch-16-50mm/dp/B00I8BICB2/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=sony+a6000&amp;qid=1584117604&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-3">Sony A6000</a> for sale at a really reasonable price. I had read lots of good things about the A6000 for vlogging, and I knew it supported clean HDMI out, so I decided to return all the Canon items I had purchased back and go the much less expensive used-Sony route.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I'm glad I did. As soon as I got it home and plugged it in, everything worked as expected, with no headaches. Clean HDMI output. Decent depth of field. No complaints. I mounted it on a cheap but reliable Amazon Basics tripod, and I set the camera to &quot;movie mode&quot; to ensure the highest quality HDMI out (using any other mode sends a much lower resolution output).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only thing worth mentioning with the Sony A6000 is that while you <em>can</em> run it on batteries, you'll only get an hour or so. I decided to purchase a relatively inexpensive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075Z4GXKG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">dummy battery</a> that lets me keep the camera on all day without needing to fuss with batteries.</p>

<h2>Lighting</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's the bullet list for my audio setup:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00APAQT4Q/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">2 x TaoTronics LED Desk Lamp</a></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you buy two of these like I did, it will cost you $60 ($30/each).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Setting It Up</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My lighting setup is simple.  I actually tried several different lighting options like LED panels, but these two LED desk lamps work out really well for me. I keep them aimed down when I'm working, then flip them up when I'm on a call. You can adjust the brightness and color temperature, and they've got USB ports on the side, handy for charging devices.</p>

<h2>Audio</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here's the bullet list for my audio setup:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JM46FY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Rode Podcaster</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D7UYBO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Rode PSA1 boom arm</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DE1K5S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Rode SM6 shock mount</a></li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This setup is about $400 if you buy everything new.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Setting It Up</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For years, I've used a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2">Blue Yeti Blackout USB microphone</a>. It's a great microphone at a really good price and does a great job. However, my office acoustics are terrible, and after a bit of research, I read that a dynamic mic might help eliminate the background noise and clean up my signal, so I picked up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JM46FY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Rode Podcaster</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So far, I've been happy with the quality. It doesn't pick up nearly as much of the echoes the Yeti did.  My only complaint is that the signal is <em>very</em> weak.  It has no built-in gain control, so the input gain on the computer needs to be set to 100% and the mic really needs to be close to the mouth in order to get a decent signal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also — if you're thinking about any boom arm, save yourself the headache and get the Rode PSA1. I've gone through many mic stands, and this one really is worth the money.</p>

<h2>Result?</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Bonus tip:</strong> If you ever need a high-resolution recording of a presentation you're giving over Zoom, you can use your DSLR camera for Zoom and record it via QuickTime at the same time.</p>

      <title>1 Year of Daily Coworking</title>
      <link>https://plasticmind.com/journal/1-year-of-daily-coworking/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s March 11, 2020 — a Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The world hasn't completely shut down yet — that will happen Friday the 13th — but things are definitely getting weird.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn't have any grand plan around building a community. I’d just been working from home for the last 10 years and knew how challenging and lonely it can be to sit in front of your computer all day not interacting with anybody in any meaningful way, and I thought offering people a place where they could chat with another a human being might be a welcome respite, especially against the backdrop of a global pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I tweeted:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:embed {"url":"https://twitter.com/plasticmind/status/1237751340975165442","type":"rich","providerNameSlug":"twitter","responsive":true,"className":""} -->
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://twitter.com/plasticmind/status/1237751340975165442
</div></figure>
<!-- /wp:embed -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first few days, only a few people joined. But over the course of a few months (and thanks to some friends sharing it with their friends), the number of people who joined continued to grow. I hosted a virtual coworking session (lovingly dubbed &quot;cowrok&quot;) almost every weekday for the last year — about 260 sessions or so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the unexpected benefits of the calls, especially early on, was that people from all around the country (and the world) began to share about how they were dealing with COVID19 — layoffs, anxiety, loss, government response, etc. That global perspective served as a potent reminder for me: <strong>we're all in this together.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People hungry for information, normalcy, and human interaction proved fertile ground for the growth of something greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've learned a lot over the last year and have some thoughts about why this idea resonated the way that it did, and I'll talk more about that <a href="https://plasticmind.com/journal/1-year-of-daily-coworking/#lessons">at the end of the post</a>, but I think it's only fitting first to say thank you to all of the people who participated in our daily calls. This community isn't really anything without them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Regulars</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lots of people came and went over the course of this past year, but these are some of the folks I’d consider more “regulars attenders” than most. Be sure to check them out, they're really neat individuals.</p>

<h2 id="lessons">Lessons Learned</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few things I’ve observed:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Consistency is key to relationship building. Even though there were only a few people who joined consistently every day, quite a lot of people who participated told me they liked knowing it was there and that they could join whenever they were able. </li><li>We never had a specific agenda or discussion topic. I’d usually let the conversation unfold organically. Sometimes the topics were deep and meaningful: are people inherently flawed? does God exist? where does morality come from? are NFTs a pyramid scheme? how are your relationships? Sometimes the topics were light and playful: what are you working on? what games are you playing? what are you cooking? what are you watching? what’s your favorite podcast? what’s annoying you right now? show us your pet! Some days we just talked about our various businesses and the puzzles we were working on.</li><li>It’s amazing the milestones that people in our group marked: ending a relationship, starting a new relationship, leaving a job, starting a new job, starting a new *company*, getting a new pet, buying a new house, finishing a difficult project, sporting new hairstyles! (Not to mention progress made toward still-yet-to-be-achieved milestones.)</li><li>I firmly believe that much of the meaningfulness of this community can be chalked up to human beings caring about other human beings. People just wanted to have someone to talk to about their fears and concerns, someone to celebrate their victories with and share their pain, someone to ask about them when they're not there. I'm very thankful for a group of people I was able to do that with.</li><li>There's nothing better than deep conversation with a wildly varied group of perspectives: national, international, city, rural, progressive, conservative, and pretty much everything in between. I feel like a more thoughtful person because of the conversations I've had there.</li><li>Serendipitous discovery was through the roof. Every call produced a list of 15-20 fantastic links for exploring.</li><li>To that end, having a place to interact outside the daily coworking calls also helped grow the community. We used Discord for all sorts of asynchronous conversations: capturing interesting links from our calls, sharing projects, sending direct messages, etc.</li><li>I was able to largely avoid Zoom-bombers by initiating a waiting room and using social media as proof of verification. At first, I’d let anyone in — I even had some really interesting conversations with people who intended to bomb the call. But after a couple of pretty terrible interactions (one verbally attacked someone in the room, another shared some violent child pornography), I decided to make this a safe space for community members and be far more judicious about letting people in. If someone joined whose name I didn’t recognize, I’d message them and ask them to DM me on Twitter or Facebook. This virtually eliminated Zoom-bombers.</li></ul>

<h3>Inside Jokes &amp; Good Memories</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's hard to pick out all the meaningful memories from 300+ hours of conversations, but here are a few good memories, quips, and inside jokes to leave you with:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Hat days.</li><li>At Christmas, we had a really fun tea/coffee exchange. Thanks to Tatiana for coordinating that.</li><li>Drawing prompts.</li><li>Among Us.</li><li>“Aristotle was like ‘let’s boogaloo everybody!’”</li><li>“It’s not an actual hellscape.”</li><li>“Babies aren’t going to get arrested by the FBI.”</li><li>“If you die in Canada, do you die in real life?”</li><li>“Yeet the rich.”</li><li>“I am neither involved in the logging industry run by giants or the conjugal services related thereto.”</li></ul>

      <content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s March 11, 2020 — a Wednesday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The world hasn't completely shut down yet — that will happen Friday the 13th — but things are definitely getting weird.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn't have any grand plan around building a community. I’d just been working from home for the last 10 years and knew how challenging and lonely it can be to sit in front of your computer all day not interacting with anybody in any meaningful way, and I thought offering people a place where they could chat with another a human being might be a welcome respite, especially against the backdrop of a global pandemic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I tweeted:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:embed {"url":"https://twitter.com/plasticmind/status/1237751340975165442","type":"rich","providerNameSlug":"twitter","responsive":true,"className":""} -->
<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://twitter.com/plasticmind/status/1237751340975165442
</div></figure>
<!-- /wp:embed -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first few days, only a few people joined. But over the course of a few months (and thanks to some friends sharing it with their friends), the number of people who joined continued to grow. I hosted a virtual coworking session (lovingly dubbed &quot;cowrok&quot;) almost every weekday for the last year — about 260 sessions or so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the unexpected benefits of the calls, especially early on, was that people from all around the country (and the world) began to share about how they were dealing with COVID19 — layoffs, anxiety, loss, government response, etc. That global perspective served as a potent reminder for me: <strong>we're all in this together.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>People hungry for information, normalcy, and human interaction proved fertile ground for the growth of something greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I've learned a lot over the last year and have some thoughts about why this idea resonated the way that it did, and I'll talk more about that <a href="https://plasticmind.com/journal/1-year-of-daily-coworking/#lessons">at the end of the post</a>, but I think it's only fitting first to say thank you to all of the people who participated in our daily calls. This community isn't really anything without them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Regulars</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lots of people came and went over the course of this past year, but these are some of the folks I’d consider more “regulars attenders” than most. Be sure to check them out, they're really neat individuals.</p>

<h2 id="lessons">Lessons Learned</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A few things I’ve observed:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Consistency is key to relationship building. Even though there were only a few people who joined consistently every day, quite a lot of people who participated told me they liked knowing it was there and that they could join whenever they were able. </li><li>We never had a specific agenda or discussion topic. I’d usually let the conversation unfold organically. Sometimes the topics were deep and meaningful: are people inherently flawed? does God exist? where does morality come from? are NFTs a pyramid scheme? how are your relationships? Sometimes the topics were light and playful: what are you working on? what games are you playing? what are you cooking? what are you watching? what’s your favorite podcast? what’s annoying you right now? show us your pet! Some days we just talked about our various businesses and the puzzles we were working on.</li><li>It’s amazing the milestones that people in our group marked: ending a relationship, starting a new relationship, leaving a job, starting a new job, starting a new *company*, getting a new pet, buying a new house, finishing a difficult project, sporting new hairstyles! (Not to mention progress made toward still-yet-to-be-achieved milestones.)</li><li>I firmly believe that much of the meaningfulness of this community can be chalked up to human beings caring about other human beings. People just wanted to have someone to talk to about their fears and concerns, someone to celebrate their victories with and share their pain, someone to ask about them when they're not there. I'm very thankful for a group of people I was able to do that with.</li><li>There's nothing better than deep conversation with a wildly varied group of perspectives: national, international, city, rural, progressive, conservative, and pretty much everything in between. I feel like a more thoughtful person because of the conversations I've had there.</li><li>Serendipitous discovery was through the roof. Every call produced a list of 15-20 fantastic links for exploring.</li><li>To that end, having a place to interact outside the daily coworking calls also helped grow the community. We used Discord for all sorts of asynchronous conversations: capturing interesting links from our calls, sharing projects, sending direct messages, etc.</li><li>I was able to largely avoid Zoom-bombers by initiating a waiting room and using social media as proof of verification. At first, I’d let anyone in — I even had some really interesting conversations with people who intended to bomb the call. But after a couple of pretty terrible interactions (one verbally attacked someone in the room, another shared some violent child pornography), I decided to make this a safe space for community members and be far more judicious about letting people in. If someone joined whose name I didn’t recognize, I’d message them and ask them to DM me on Twitter or Facebook. This virtually eliminated Zoom-bombers.</li></ul>

<h3>Inside Jokes &amp; Good Memories</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It's hard to pick out all the meaningful memories from 300+ hours of conversations, but here are a few good memories, quips, and inside jokes to leave you with:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Hat days.</li><li>At Christmas, we had a really fun tea/coffee exchange. Thanks to Tatiana for coordinating that.</li><li>Drawing prompts.</li><li>Among Us.</li><li>“Aristotle was like ‘let’s boogaloo everybody!’”</li><li>“It’s not an actual hellscape.”</li><li>“Babies aren’t going to get arrested by the FBI.”</li><li>“If you die in Canada, do you die in real life?”</li><li>“Yeet the rich.”</li><li>“I am neither involved in the logging industry run by giants or the conjugal services related thereto.”</li></ul>

      <title>2022 In Review: Home &amp; Family</title>
      <link>https://plasticmind.com/journal/2022-in-review-home-and-family/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve got so many updates from 2022 that a single post wouldn’t cut it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s not true. I <em>could</em> put it into a single post, but it would be far too long for the modern individual’s dwindling attention span. How will my written words hope to compete with TikTok’s 3.33s average watch time? Not to worry — I’ve cut this into smaller, digestible chunks! 2000 words is hardly digestible, you say?! I’ve added exclamation points to keep the energy high! You made it through that entire sentence! Let’s go!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>A Weird Year</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I need to start things off with a confession: this was an odd year for our family, and it’s mostly because of me. <a href="https://plasticmind.com/journeys/farewell-fox/">I won’t belabor the point since I’ve written about this elsewhere</a>, but I left an executive role at Fox in August. My career decisions impacted our family quite a bit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was working my corporate job in the first half of the year, I had money but very little time. Now that I’ve started my own business, I have time but little money. I keeping falling victim to the flawed mindset that may sound familiar to some of you: “When full-time-jobbing, must work endlessly so as not to jeopardize said job. When new-business-starting, must work endlessly to secure work.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I mention this up front because of the impact this unhealthy cycle had on my family. I didn’t prioritize non-work matters like I should. I spent time with family, but it was always second-class time, scraps leftover after I was spent for the day. In short, I didn’t give my family and home life the intentionality that I gave my professional life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That will change in 2023. More to come on that in a later post.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>The Family</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll share my own personal updates from 2022 in a later post, but here are some of this year’s goings-on from the rest of our family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Jessica</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No two ways about it: my wife’s superpower is her thoughtfulness and productivity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was the busiest year yet with her candle business, The Thoughtful Gardner. We wrote up <a href="https://thoughtfulgardner.com/blogs/feed/2022-state-of-the-gardn">a year-in-review over on the site</a>, but in short, she was very busy this year, selling over 600 candles and carving out some really unique business channels and partnerships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also continues to serve on the steering committee at a local homeschool group our family is involved with. That role has been especially important during and after the pandemic. For a better part of the year, she and Ethan have been volunteering at a local food pantry, and she’s volunteered weekly as a teacher Sunday mornings for the pre-k and kindergarten children at our church.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And she still managed to win a chili-cook-off and finish reading 70 books this year. Like I said: superhero.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We celebrated our 17th anniversary this year with a trip to NYC. We saw Wicked, took a food tour of Greenwich Village, and wandered around MoMA and the New York Public Library. We also took a private tour of the New York State Archives for Jessica’s birthday. I can’t stress this enough: what a glorious feeling when you find someone who enjoys the same unusual things you do. 💕</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:image {"id":6187,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_3469-1024x613.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6187" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Ethan</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ethan continues the long journey through the teen years. Can you believe we’re already having conversations about driving and college!? No surprises, he’s a really social kid. He loves the friends he’s made at the youth group and home school group. He’s got considerable emotional intelligence; we’re just trying to channel that toward peace and consideration. 🙃</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Karate is still a big part of his life. He’s now a 1st degree Shodan (初段) black belt. He competed in the 518 Martial Arts Winter Cup and won 3rd place. He participated in a demonstration at the Valley Cats in Troy. He also took a leadership class and has been helping lead some of the younger student classes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY31tcGh6NJ1hIrdqAOjwOw">a YouTube channel called Insight Unlocked</a> where he reviews tech gadgets and shares tech tips. This was all his own doing, and he’s shown a lot of drive keeping it going. Also, his editing and style is on point. 🔥</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:image {"id":6188,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_0559_jpg.JPG-1024x602.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6188" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Anna</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anna also started <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zeldatalks">a fun little TikTok channel called Zelda Talks</a> where she dreams up scenarios for our dog Zelda, using Elliot’s voice to play the story out. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjY8PvhdGvuI9lhhX7ySwg">She publishes to YouTube, too.</a>) She’s also been very driven about creating content. I haven’t really said anything to either one about it; they like it and keep making that content!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anna was baptized in July, and this was her first year in youth group. We were a little nervous how she’d do since she tends toward introversion, but she <em>loved</em> it and has really picked up a gaggle of friends. She’s also really enjoying the home school group she’s a part of and has made several really close friends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gymnastics is still a big part of her life. One of her goals for 2022 was to get her round-off back handspring on the floor, and halfway through the year — she did! She competed in several meets this year and took 4th place overall for her class.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s also continued to improve her cooking and baking skills. Just a few weeks ago she made a chocolate babka from scratch, and it was delightful. I’m not sure I’m going to keep to my health goals if she keeps this up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:image {"id":6189,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_1370-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6189" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Elijah</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elijah finished his first full year of karate, passing his test and getting a blue kyu belt. He had a goal this year to get stronger, and he definitely has. He’s continuing to show interest in veterinary sciences. He’s fascinated with animals, loves learning about them, talking about them, taking care of them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s a Lego-maniac, inspired by his cousin Josh who is a Lego-master in his own right. One of Elijah’s 2023 goals is building at least 10 new large Lego sets, so we can improve his Lego building skill in general. He’s also wants to improve his handwriting, a goal he set for himself. He even wrote out a sample of his handwriting so that when he reviews his goals next year, he can see how much improvement he’s made.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He loves to play Fortnite. It’s amazing to me how little he cares about the game and how much it’s just a social network for him. Even though he’s not on any actual social media, he’s able to jump into a match of Fortnite with friends who have moved away or other family members and just chat with them. Welcome to the future!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another goal Elijah set for 2023 is to learn to ride a bike.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:image {"id":6190,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_0568-1024x568.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6190" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Elliot</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s hard to believe Elliot just turned 4. He’s a very vocal child, and has mastered quite a lot for his age. He can read and write numbers up to 10. He recognizes all the letters in the alphabet. He’s even able to read and write his own name.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s a parrot, and fiercely independent. He watches the siblings with a hawk-eye, and copies them as best he can. Just don’t try to help him… he’ll do it on his own. 😄</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is especially evident with music. He’s really taken to the piano lately. He’ll sit down at the piano for 15-20 minutes and play the chords I’ve taught him. I’d really like to nurture that interest if possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elliot’s (well, <em>mom’s)</em> big goal is to get him potty-trained this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:image {"id":6191,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_0913-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6191" /></figure>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The Homestead</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Outside</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn’t just family time that suffered this year. I invested very little time this year around our property and home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I did cut down a few pine trees to make room for an expansion of our orchard and berry patch, but beyond the miracles Jessica performed with the large flower garden in the center of our circle driveway, our property went largely untended. We neglected our vegetable garden, and left quite a bit of work we had planned around the hobby farm unfinished.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:image {"id":6192,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CleanShot-2023-01-01-at-22.11.04@2x-1024x625.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6192" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve got a lot of plans for the next year. Put in a new retaining wall, walkway, and shade trees next to our back porch — the current wall is collapsing and the cedar have died. Install a shade sail over the back porch. Build a new chicken coop and pen further away from the garage. Move the raspberry to a dedicated area of the property and expand it significantly. Double the size of the orchard. Move the vegetable garden. Seal coat the driveway. Replace all the shutters. Fix spindles and columns on the front porch and repaint. Clearly, we’ve got our work cut out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Inside</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year <em>was</em> a big one for work inside the house, primarily because I was able to hire someone to do it. In case you haven’t seen it, these bathroom transformations are 🔥🔥🔥. My sister helped design the space, and my brother made it a reality. If you’re wondering, yes, you can <a href="https://funcycled.com/design-services/">hire Sarah to help you with your interior designs</a> and you can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RevivalRenovationsNewYork">hire Nathan to remodel your bathroom</a> (if you’re in Upstate NY).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:image {"id":6193,"sizeSlug":"full","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6193" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also considered the possibility of having family moving in with us for a time. Since we don’t have enough room in our house for anyone else to stay, we did drew up some plans and renderings to imagine what would it look like to finish part of our basement and turn it into a small standalone apartment. We didn’t end up needing it, but we’re still considering building this out to make it easier (thus, more likely) for friends and out-of-town family to visit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given all we have planned for outside, this might have to wait until 2024.</p>

<h2>And So Much More…</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a lot more I could write about.</p>

      <content><![CDATA[<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve got so many updates from 2022 that a single post wouldn’t cut it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s not true. I <em>could</em> put it into a single post, but it would be far too long for the modern individual’s dwindling attention span. How will my written words hope to compete with TikTok’s 3.33s average watch time? Not to worry — I’ve cut this into smaller, digestible chunks! 2000 words is hardly digestible, you say?! I’ve added exclamation points to keep the energy high! You made it through that entire sentence! Let’s go!</p>

<h2>A Weird Year</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I need to start things off with a confession: this was an odd year for our family, and it’s mostly because of me. <a href="https://plasticmind.com/journeys/farewell-fox/">I won’t belabor the point since I’ve written about this elsewhere</a>, but I left an executive role at Fox in August. My career decisions impacted our family quite a bit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was working my corporate job in the first half of the year, I had money but very little time. Now that I’ve started my own business, I have time but little money. I keeping falling victim to the flawed mindset that may sound familiar to some of you: “When full-time-jobbing, must work endlessly so as not to jeopardize said job. When new-business-starting, must work endlessly to secure work.”</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I mention this up front because of the impact this unhealthy cycle had on my family. I didn’t prioritize non-work matters like I should. I spent time with family, but it was always second-class time, scraps leftover after I was spent for the day. In short, I didn’t give my family and home life the intentionality that I gave my professional life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That will change in 2023. More to come on that in a later post.</p>

<h2>The Family</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll share my own personal updates from 2022 in a later post, but here are some of this year’s goings-on from the rest of our family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Jessica</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No two ways about it: my wife’s superpower is her thoughtfulness and productivity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was the busiest year yet with her candle business, The Thoughtful Gardner. We wrote up <a href="https://thoughtfulgardner.com/blogs/feed/2022-state-of-the-gardn">a year-in-review over on the site</a>, but in short, she was very busy this year, selling over 600 candles and carving out some really unique business channels and partnerships.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She also continues to serve on the steering committee at a local homeschool group our family is involved with. That role has been especially important during and after the pandemic. For a better part of the year, she and Ethan have been volunteering at a local food pantry, and she’s volunteered weekly as a teacher Sunday mornings for the pre-k and kindergarten children at our church.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And she still managed to win a chili-cook-off and finish reading 70 books this year. Like I said: superhero.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We celebrated our 17th anniversary this year with a trip to NYC. We saw Wicked, took a food tour of Greenwich Village, and wandered around MoMA and the New York Public Library. We also took a private tour of the New York State Archives for Jessica’s birthday. I can’t stress this enough: what a glorious feeling when you find someone who enjoys the same unusual things you do. 💕</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Ethan</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ethan continues the long journey through the teen years. Can you believe we’re already having conversations about driving and college!? No surprises, he’s a really social kid. He loves the friends he’s made at the youth group and home school group. He’s got considerable emotional intelligence; we’re just trying to channel that toward peace and consideration. 🙃</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Karate is still a big part of his life. He’s now a 1st degree Shodan (初段) black belt. He competed in the 518 Martial Arts Winter Cup and won 3rd place. He participated in a demonstration at the Valley Cats in Troy. He also took a leadership class and has been helping lead some of the younger student classes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY31tcGh6NJ1hIrdqAOjwOw">a YouTube channel called Insight Unlocked</a> where he reviews tech gadgets and shares tech tips. This was all his own doing, and he’s shown a lot of drive keeping it going. Also, his editing and style is on point. 🔥</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Anna</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anna also started <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@zeldatalks">a fun little TikTok channel called Zelda Talks</a> where she dreams up scenarios for our dog Zelda, using Elliot’s voice to play the story out. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjY8PvhdGvuI9lhhX7ySwg">She publishes to YouTube, too.</a>) She’s also been very driven about creating content. I haven’t really said anything to either one about it; they like it and keep making that content!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anna was baptized in July, and this was her first year in youth group. We were a little nervous how she’d do since she tends toward introversion, but she <em>loved</em> it and has really picked up a gaggle of friends. She’s also really enjoying the home school group she’s a part of and has made several really close friends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gymnastics is still a big part of her life. One of her goals for 2022 was to get her round-off back handspring on the floor, and halfway through the year — she did! She competed in several meets this year and took 4th place overall for her class.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She’s also continued to improve her cooking and baking skills. Just a few weeks ago she made a chocolate babka from scratch, and it was delightful. I’m not sure I’m going to keep to my health goals if she keeps this up.</p>

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Elijah</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elijah finished his first full year of karate, passing his test and getting a blue kyu belt. He had a goal this year to get stronger, and he definitely has. He’s continuing to show interest in veterinary sciences. He’s fascinated with animals, loves learning about them, talking about them, taking care of them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s a Lego-maniac, inspired by his cousin Josh who is a Lego-master in his own right. One of Elijah’s 2023 goals is building at least 10 new large Lego sets, so we can improve his Lego building skill in general. He’s also wants to improve his handwriting, a goal he set for himself. He even wrote out a sample of his handwriting so that when he reviews his goals next year, he can see how much improvement he’s made.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He loves to play Fortnite. It’s amazing to me how little he cares about the game and how much it’s just a social network for him. Even though he’s not on any actual social media, he’s able to jump into a match of Fortnite with friends who have moved away or other family members and just chat with them. Welcome to the future!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another goal Elijah set for 2023 is to learn to ride a bike.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Elliot</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s hard to believe Elliot just turned 4. He’s a very vocal child, and has mastered quite a lot for his age. He can read and write numbers up to 10. He recognizes all the letters in the alphabet. He’s even able to read and write his own name.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He’s a parrot, and fiercely independent. He watches the siblings with a hawk-eye, and copies them as best he can. Just don’t try to help him… he’ll do it on his own. 😄</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This is especially evident with music. He’s really taken to the piano lately. He’ll sit down at the piano for 15-20 minutes and play the chords I’ve taught him. I’d really like to nurture that interest if possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Elliot’s (well, <em>mom’s)</em> big goal is to get him potty-trained this year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<h2>The Homestead</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Outside</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn’t just family time that suffered this year. I invested very little time this year around our property and home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I did cut down a few pine trees to make room for an expansion of our orchard and berry patch, but beyond the miracles Jessica performed with the large flower garden in the center of our circle driveway, our property went largely untended. We neglected our vegetable garden, and left quite a bit of work we had planned around the hobby farm unfinished.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:image {"id":6192,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CleanShot-2023-01-01-at-22.11.04@2x-1024x625.png" alt="" class="wp-image-6192" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We’ve got a lot of plans for the next year. Put in a new retaining wall, walkway, and shade trees next to our back porch — the current wall is collapsing and the cedar have died. Install a shade sail over the back porch. Build a new chicken coop and pen further away from the garage. Move the raspberry to a dedicated area of the property and expand it significantly. Double the size of the orchard. Move the vegetable garden. Seal coat the driveway. Replace all the shutters. Fix spindles and columns on the front porch and repaint. Clearly, we’ve got our work cut out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Inside</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This year <em>was</em> a big one for work inside the house, primarily because I was able to hire someone to do it. In case you haven’t seen it, these bathroom transformations are 🔥🔥🔥. My sister helped design the space, and my brother made it a reality. If you’re wondering, yes, you can <a href="https://funcycled.com/design-services/">hire Sarah to help you with your interior designs</a> and you can <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RevivalRenovationsNewYork">hire Nathan to remodel your bathroom</a> (if you’re in Upstate NY).</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img src="https://plasticmind.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Untitled-design.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-6193" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We also considered the possibility of having family moving in with us for a time. Since we don’t have enough room in our house for anyone else to stay, we did drew up some plans and renderings to imagine what would it look like to finish part of our basement and turn it into a small standalone apartment. We didn’t end up needing it, but we’re still considering building this out to make it easier (thus, more likely) for friends and out-of-town family to visit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Given all we have planned for outside, this might have to wait until 2024.</p>

<h2>And So Much More…</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There’s a lot more I could write about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Weekend dinners with our extended family. Trick-or-treating for the first time. Losing our cat. Ice skating at the Empire State Plaza. Sweating buckets at the circus.</p>
