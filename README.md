# Born Again Plasticmind.com

Working on a new [plasticmind.com](https://plasticmind.com), rebuilt from the ground up.

After a decade on Movable Type and another decade on WordPress, I'm shedding bulk. This is a more intentional publishing stack powered by [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), Git, and plain Markdown (I do most of my writing in Obsidian) — less weight, less distraction.

## Why This Exists

I’ve been writing online since the mid-90's, and I've never been good at segmenting. My posts are a mix of personal, technical, reflective. The goal has always been making the invisible stuff visible and talking about the complexities of the world: systems, behaviors, decisions, politics, love, and human beings.

Here are my guiding principles for this new site:
- **Readable by default**: great typography, adjustable settings, accessible to everyone;
- **Time-aware**: archives that lean into the passage of time instead of hiding it;
- **Subtly accessible**: keyboard navigable, pull-to-load, thoughtful UI for easy reading;
- **Less flashy**: simple design and engineering architecture, so this lasts a while (since I'd rather be writing than redesigning).

## What’s Here

- **Writing**: I'm cleaning up my posts to remove the detritus and organizing my blog with better tagging and organization;
- **Work**: I figured my professional resume shouldn't just exist on LinkedIn;
- **Projects** — notable side work, experiments, and collaborations worth remembering over the years;
- **Archives** — less about search, and more about browsing through time;
- **Better UI** — dark mode, adjustable type size, and a more reader-friendly experience overall.

## Colophon

- [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) — for static generation
- [GitHub](https://github.com/plasticmind/site-plasticmind.com) — for versioning and deployment
- [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) — for theme and type flexibility
- No bloated frameworks: just small, loosely-joined pieces.

For those of you who’ve followed this site through its various incarnations... thanks!
